I am a master's student in <a href = "https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/studium/master/master-social-and-economic-data-science/">social and economic data science</a> at the University of Konstanz. I concentrate on comparative politics—especially migration, state capacity, and public finance—with a substantive focus on Central and Eastern Europe. I am also working as a research assistant in the Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality with Prof. Christina Zuber on <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/administrative-inequality-in-handling-requests-for-german-citizenship/">administrative inequality in the processing of applications for German citizenship</a>.  </font><br></p>
