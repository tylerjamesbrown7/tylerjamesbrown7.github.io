I'm a master's student in <a href = "https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/studium/master/master-social-and-economic-data-science/">social and economic data science</a> at the University of Konstanz. I'm interested in comparative politics—especially migration, state capacity, and public finance—with a substantive focus on Central and Eastern Europe. Currently I am working for Prof. Christina Zuber as a research assistant in the Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality on the AdmInCit project. </font><br></p>
