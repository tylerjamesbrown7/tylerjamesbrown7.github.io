**_ABOUT ME_**  
Hey! I'm currently a research fellow at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid in the department of economics. In the fall, I'll be a new master's student at Universit√§t Konstanz in the Social and Economic Data Science program. I work on migration, political economy, and European politics. My research interests include interactions between the state and social change, as well as the growth of radical right politics in Europe.
