I recently finished my master's in <a href = "https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/studium/master/master-social-and-economic-data-science/">social and economic data science</a> at the University of Konstanz. I concentrate on comparative politics—especially party organizations—with a substantive focus on Central and Eastern Europe. My master's project, "Sharpened pencils: new parties and old elites after democratization," analyzes political selection after regime change in Poland using an original dataset from the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej (Institute of National Remembrance) on secret police collaborators and Communist-era officials.<br><br>
                        
                        I work with Prof. Christina Zuber on <a href="https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/zuber/research/nationalism-and-democratic-backsliding/">nationalism and democratic backsliding</a>, where I handle data and historical analysis in Croatia. Prior to this project, I worked on in the Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality on "Administrative inequality in the handling of applications for German citizenship" merging administrative data from all 16 Bundesländer in Germany. </font><br></p>
