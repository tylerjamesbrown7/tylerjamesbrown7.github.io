I am a master's student in <a href = "https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/studium/master/master-social-and-economic-data-science/">social and economic data science</a> at the University of Konstanz. I concentrate on comparative politics—especially parties, bureaucracy, and democratization—with a substantive focus on Central and Eastern Europe. My ongoing master's project addresses post-democratization party strategy in Poland using an original dataset from the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej (Institute of National Remembrance) on secret police collaborators and Communist-era officials.<br>
                        
                        I also work as a research assistant in the Cluster of Excellence: The Politics of Inequality with Prof. Christina Zuber on <a href="https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/zuber/research/nationalism-and-democratic-backsliding/">nationalism and democratic backsliding</a>, where I handle data and historical analysis in Croatia.</font><br></p>
